We press on the Get Started Button that directs us to the BMI calculator page.
We now give all the values like height,weight,age,acitivity level,gender and the goal we'd like to achieve and finally press on the button Calculate.
We now are provided with our BMI and our TDEE Calories and we can compare it with the graph given below to check where we lie and also the macronutrients you are supposed to eat are given below the graph.
After calculating BMI a get diet plan button will pop up, we should click it which will direct us to another page that lets us choose our Mess type.
After choosing your desired mess type, press on the get diet plan button and it will take you to the final page which consists of the diet plan you need and what items and their respective calories mentioned.
We also added an about page which you can check by pressing on about text which is on top of the page on the navigation header.
